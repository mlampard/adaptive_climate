## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-27

### ðŸ”§ Architecture Refactor: Controller Pattern

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Refactored from climate entity to controller/coordinator pattern
- Component now acts as an intelligent controller that manages existing climate entities
- No longer creates a new climate entity, works with your existing thermostats/HVAC systems
- Updated integration type to "service" in manifest.json
- Removed climate.py file and related climate entity code

#### Added
- **AdaptiveClimateCoordinator**: New coordinator class that manages control logic
- **Diagnostic Sensors**: Rich sensor platform with comfort temperature, ranges, and compliance
- **Binary Sensors**: ASHRAE compliance and natural ventilation recommendation sensors
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: All ASHRAE calculations now exposed as separate sensors
- **Better Integration**: Works seamlessly with any existing Home Assistant climate entity

#### Improved
- **Service Architecture**: More robust service-based approach for better integration
- **Entity Management**: Cleaner entity lifecycle management
- **Performance**: Reduced overhead by not creating unnecessary climate entities
- **Compatibility**: Better compatibility with existing climate setups

#### Developer Notes
- Updated README.md to reflect new architecture
- All diagnostic data now available through dedicated sensor entities
- Services now operate on config entry level rather than entity level
