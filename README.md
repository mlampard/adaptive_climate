## 🚀 ASHRAE 55 Adaptive Climate Control

**Development Version: 0.1.0** - Intelligent climate control based on ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard.

Advanced Home Assistant custom component that automatically adjusts HVAC systems based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard. This intelligent climate control provides 15-30% energy savings while maintaining optimal comfort by dynamically calculating comfort zones based on outdoor temperature conditions.

## Features

### 🏆 ASHRAE 55 Adaptive Comfort Model
- **Certified Implementation**: Full ASHRAE 55-2020 standard compliance
- **Energy Optimization**: 15-30% energy savings through intelligent setpoint adjustment
- **Occupancy Awareness**: Automatic setback and energy saving when space is unoccupied  
- **Natural Ventilation Detection**: Automatically turns off HVAC when outdoor conditions are suitable
- **Smart Air Velocity Control**: Adaptive fan speed based on temperature deviation
- **Humidity Compensation**: Comfort adjustments based on indoor humidity levels
- **Multiple Comfort Categories**: Support for ASHRAE 55 Categories I, II, and III
- **Climate Platform Compatible**: Works with SmartIR, Generic Thermostat, and other climate entities

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Go to HACS > Integrations.
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories".
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/msinhore/adaptive-climate`
5. Select "Integration" as the category.
6. Click "Add".
7. Search for "Adaptive Climate" in HACS and install it.
8. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `adaptive_climate`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/adaptive_climate/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

The integration is configured through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services.
2. Click "Add Integration".
3. Search for "Adaptive Climate".
4. Follow the configuration steps.

### Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Basic Setup
- **Name**: Choose a name for your adaptive climate system
- **Climate Entity**: Select the climate device to control (SmartIR, generic thermostat, etc.)
- **Indoor Temperature Sensor**: Temperature sensor for the controlled space
- **Outdoor Temperature Sensor**: Outdoor temperature sensor for adaptive calculations
- **Comfort Category**: Choose ASHRAE 55 comfort category:
  - Category I: ±2°C (90% satisfaction) - Office environments
  - Category II: ±3°C (80% satisfaction) - Typical residential
  - Category III: ±4°C (65% satisfaction) - Maximum energy savings

#### Step 2: Advanced Options
- **Occupancy Sensor**: Motion/presence sensor for occupancy-aware control
- **Mean Radiant Temperature Sensor**: For operative temperature calculations
- **Humidity Sensors**: Indoor and outdoor humidity for enhanced comfort
- **Use Operative Temperature**: Enable operative temperature calculation
- **Energy Save Mode**: Enhanced energy saving features
- **Precision Mode**: High-precision calculations
- **Natural Ventilation Detection**: Auto-disable HVAC when suitable
- **Adaptive Air Velocity**: Automatic fan speed control
- **Humidity Comfort Correction**: Humidity-based adjustments
- **Auto Shutdown**: Turn off HVAC after prolonged absence

#### Step 3: Thresholds & Limits
- **Temperature Limits**: Absolute minimum and maximum comfort temperatures
- **Change Threshold**: Minimum temperature difference to trigger adjustments
- **Air Velocity**: Typical air velocity in the space
- **Natural Ventilation Threshold**: Temperature difference for natural ventilation
- **Setback Offset**: Temperature offset when unoccupied
- **Absence Timers**: Time thresholds for energy saving modes

## How It Works

### ASHRAE 55 Adaptive Comfort Model

The adaptive comfort model is based on the relationship between outdoor temperature and indoor comfort:

```
Comfort Temperature = 18.9 + 0.255 × Outdoor Temperature
```

The system dynamically adjusts the comfort zone based on:
- Current outdoor temperature (10-40°C valid range)
- Selected comfort category (±2°C, ±3°C, or ±4°C tolerance)
- Indoor conditions and occupancy status
- Air velocity and humidity corrections (in precision mode)

### Intelligent Control Logic

1. **Natural Ventilation Priority**: When outdoor conditions are suitable, HVAC is disabled
2. **Adaptive Setpoints**: Comfort zone adjusts based on outdoor temperature
3. **Occupancy Awareness**: Setback temperatures when unoccupied
4. **Fan Speed Optimization**: Increases cooling sensation through air movement
5. **Humidity Compensation**: Adjusts comfort based on indoor humidity levels

### Energy Savings

- **Dynamic Setpoints**: Wider comfort zones reduce HVAC runtime
- **Occupancy Setback**: Temperature offset when space is unoccupied
- **Natural Ventilation**: HVAC shutdown when outdoor air is suitable
- **Auto Shutdown**: Turn off HVAC after prolonged absence
- **Optimized Fan Control**: Use air movement for comfort instead of cooling

## Supported Climate Platforms

- SmartIR (IR-controlled air conditioners)
- Generic Thermostat
- Climate templates
- Any Home Assistant climate entity

## Sensors and Attributes

The integration provides rich sensor data and attributes:

### Main Attributes
- `adaptive_comfort_temp`: Calculated adaptive comfort temperature
- `comfort_temp_min`/`comfort_temp_max`: Current comfort zone boundaries
- `comfort_category`: Selected ASHRAE 55 category
- `hvac_mode_recommendation`: Recommended HVAC mode
- `natural_ventilation_available`: Whether natural ventilation is suitable
- `compliance_notes`: ASHRAE 55 compliance status

### Advanced Attributes
- `operative_temp`: Operative temperature (if radiant sensor available)
- `optimal_fan_speed`: Recommended fan speed
- `occupancy_state`: Current occupancy status
- `manual_override`: Whether manual control is active
- `auto_shutdown_active`: Auto shutdown status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Entity Not Found**: Ensure all selected entities exist and are available
2. **No Temperature Changes**: Check temperature change threshold settings
3. **HVAC Not Responding**: Verify climate entity supports the required services
4. **Occupancy Not Working**: Ensure occupancy sensor is properly configured

### Debug Logging

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` for debug logging:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.adaptive_climate: debug
```
