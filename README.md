- Accounts for air velocity and humidity corrections
- Uses operative temperature when radiant temperature sensors are available

### Service-Based Configuration
- **All parameters as attributes**: View all settings in one place
- **Service management**: Use Home Assistant services to change any setting
- **No UI clutter**: Clean device page with only essential status
- **Future-proof architecture**: Follows HA 2025.7+ patterns

### Intelligent Climate Control
- Automatically controls your existing climate entities (thermostats, HVAC systems)
- Calculates optimal comfort temperatures and applies them to your hardware
- Natural ventilation detection and recommendation  
- Adaptive fan speed control based on comfort requirements
- Manual override with automatic timeout functionality
- Works as a coordinator - no new climate entity created

### Energy Efficiency
- Occupancy-based setback with configurable temperature offsets
- Automatic system shutdown during extended absence periods
- Dynamic comfort zones that adapt to seasonal changes
- Natural ventilation prioritization when conditions are suitable

### Rich Diagnostic Sensors
- Real-time ASHRAE 55 compliance monitoring
- Comfort temperature, range, and outdoor running mean sensors

## Overview

This component acts as a smart controller/coordinator that enhances your existing climate entities (thermostats, HVAC systems) with ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort intelligence. Instead of creating a new climate entity, it works behind the scenes to automatically adjust your existing climate systems based on adaptive comfort principles while providing rich diagnostic sensors for monitoring and automation.

## Key Features

### ASHRAE 55 Adaptive Comfort Model
- Calculates optimal comfort temperatures using the adaptive model: `18.9 + 0.255 √ó Outdoor Temperature`
- Supports three comfort categories (I, II, III) with different tolerance levels
- Accounts for air velocity and humidity corrections
- Uses operative temperature when radiant temperature sensors are available

### Service-Based Configuration
- **All parameters as attributes**: View all settings in one place
- **Service management**: Use Home Assistant services to change any setting
- **No UI clutter**: Clean device page with only essential status
- **Future-proof architecture**: Follows HA 2025.7+ patterns

### Intelligent Climate Control
- Automatically controls your existing climate entities (thermostats, HVAC systems)
- Calculates optimal comfort temperatures and applies them to your hardware
- Natural ventilation detection and recommendation  
- Adaptive fan speed control based on comfort requirements
- Manual override with automatic timeout functionality
- Works as a coordinator - no new climate entity created

### Energy Efficiency
- Occupancy-based setback with configurable temperature offsets
- Automatic system shutdown during extended absence periods
- Dynamic comfort zones that adapt to seasonal changes
- Natural ventilation prioritization when conditions are suitable

### Rich Diagnostic Sensors
- Real-time ASHRAE 55 compliance monitoring
- Comfort temperature, range, and outdoor running mean sensors
- Binary sensors for natural ventilation and compliance status
- Comprehensive attributes for Home Assistant automations
- All sensors are automatically created for monitoring and dashboards
- Rich attributes for integration with Home Assistant automations

## Key Features

### ASHRAE 55 Adaptive Comfort Model
- Calculates optimal comfort temperatures using the adaptive model: `18.9 + 0.255 √ó Outdoor Temperature`
- Supports three comfort categories (I, II, III) with different tolerance levels
- Accounts for air velocity and humidity corrections
- Uses operative temperature when radiant temperature sensors are available

### Service-Based Configuration
- **All parameters as attributes**: View all settings in one place
- **Service management**: Use Home Assistant services to change any setting
- **No UI clutter**: Clean device page with only essential status
- **Future-proof architecture**: Follows HA 2025.7+ patterns

### Intelligent Climate Control
- Automatically controls your existing climate entities (thermostats, HVAC systems)
- Calculates optimal comfort temperatures and applies them to your hardware
- Natural ventilation detection and recommendation  
- Adaptive fan speed control based on comfort requirements
- Manual override with automatic timeout functionality
- Works as a coordinator - no new climate entity created

### Energy Efficiency
- Occupancy-based setback with configurable temperature offsets
- Automatic system shutdown during extended absence periods
- Dynamic comfort zones that adapt to seasonal changes
- Natural ventilation prioritization when conditions are suitable

### Rich Diagnostic Sensors
- Real-time ASHRAE 55 compliance monitoring
- Comfort temperature, range, and outdoor running mean sensors
- Binary sensors for natural ventilation and compliance status
- Comprehensive attributes for Home Assistant automations
- All sensors are automatically created for monitoring and dashboards
- Rich attributes for integration with Home Assistant automations
